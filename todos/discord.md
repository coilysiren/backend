# Discord wishlist

Credentials: bot token in `../discord-bot/`. Env var: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.

## Ideas

1. **Personal command bus** — a `!remind`, `!todo`, `!note` command set that writes into
   a Redis-backed personal scratchpad I can read from anywhere.
2. **Channel-to-RSS** — export a chosen channel's pinned messages as an RSS feed, so I
   can subscribe to "things I starred in Discord" from any reader.
3. **Reaction archive** — log every message I react to with ⭐, build a personal
   "favorites" feed across every server I'm in.
4. **Lurker stats** — for servers I'm in, show me which channels actually had activity
   today so I can stop opening dead ones.
5. **Voice-channel presence log** — record (locally) when I joined and left voice
   channels. Surfaces "I spent 14 hours in voice chat this week, maybe go outside".
6. **Quote bot** — `!quote @user` randomly pulls one of their messages from the last
   year. Server in-jokes, immortalized.
7. **Cross-server DM digest** — daily summary of unread DMs across every server, so I
   stop missing pings.

## Cross-service bonus

- **Discord × GitHub**: `!issue` command opens a GitHub issue in a chosen repo from a
  Discord message, including the message author and a permalink.
- **Discord × Bluesky**: a channel that mirrors my Bluesky notifications so I can
  triage replies without opening the app.
- **Discord × Steam**: rich-presence-style status updates posted to a channel — "Kai
  started playing X" — opt-in per game.
- **Discord × Anthropic (Claude Code)**: `!claude {prompt}` command that dispatches a
  Cowork task and posts the result back when it finishes. Personal Claude over Discord.
- **Discord × YouTube**: post new uploads from a watchlist of channels into a
  `#video-club` channel for async watchalongs.
